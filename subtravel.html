       <h1>Tel Aviv</h1>
       <h3><bold>---Nonstop City</bold></h3>
   <div id="bg">
       <p>I did a one-month internship for Tel Aviv Municipality during DLD Tel Aviv Innovation Festival (the biggest innovation festival in the middle-east area). The experience was incredible! Thousands of startups, investors, dreamers gathered together in this small but very diverse and tolerant city during last summer. Innovation, design, lifestyle were three key words for the festival but also represent the spirit of Tel Aviv. It is called nonstop city for its famous nightlife; it is also the most gay-friendly city in the world; it has countless beautiful beaches 5 min away from city hall; it makes you feel coming home.</p>
